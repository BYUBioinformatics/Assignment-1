# BIO 365 - Assignment 1

The purpose of this assignment is to help you become more familiar with basic R coding.

1. Please write an R script called `Problem1.R` that declares a variable called `greeting` and assigns a value of `Hello, World!` to that variable. Then print the value of this variable.

2. Please declare a variable that stores an *integer* value of `2` and another variable that stores a *numeric* value of the same number. Print the values of these variables (*in the same order* they were mentioned above). Then use the `class` function to obtain and print the type of these variables (in the same order they were mentioned above).

3. Please declare a variable that stores a *string* value of `8460.2`. Print the value of this variable. Then convert the value to a *numeric* and print that value. Finally, convert the float value to an *integer* and print that value.

4. Please declare a variable called `numLions` that stores an integer value of `42`. Declare another variable called `numTigers` that stores an integer value of `17`. Declare another variable called `country` that stores a string value of `South Africa`. Print a message that indicates the following: "The number of lions in South Africa is 42. The number of tigers in South Africa is 17." **Your Python code must use these variables, and the first two variables must be declared as integers.**

5. The following code results in an error.

```
bioinformatics = 1
is = 2
for = 3
cool = 4
people = 5
print(bioinformatics + is + for + cool + people)
```

First run the code as it is shown above so you can see what error message this code gives. Then fix the code so that it calculates the sum of the three integers.
