#An ecologist is studying the effects of ambient temperature on nematode worm development. Her strategy is to #place the worms in small boxes and then to place these boxes under different levels of heat exposure in her lab. #In total, she has 341 worms. Write code that performs the calculations described below and prints each answer.
#
#    If exactly 26 worms can fit in a single box, what is the minimum number of boxes she should buy so that #there will be enough room for all the worms?

#    Assuming that she places 26 worms in all the boxes except the last one, how many worms will be in the last box?
